# Overview

This is my first program using the C++ language. It is a calculator program that runs basic arithmetic operations and error handling in the command line. 
I used functions, variables, expressions, loops, conditions, vectors, and writing to files to expand my knowledge of C++.   
This project was made to help me learn the C++ language and how to use Visual Studio.
